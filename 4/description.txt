The page replacement algorithm is located in PageFault.java file, 
and it's a FIFO (First In, First Out) algorithm.
It uses a while loop to find the proper page while making sure that
number of mapped pages is smaller or equal than virtPageNum.
Later, it brings oldestPage from memory into Page object.
Then sets the physical memory address of the page to be added equal 
to the page to be removed, and then removes the page.
