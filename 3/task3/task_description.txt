For 2 processes we can see that the simulation in total ran for 4000 ms 
(shorter time that 10000 ms specified in conf file), with each process running
for 2000 ms. They were CPU blocked 3 times, every 500 ms (500, 1000, 1500).

For 5 processes we can see similar results, just repeated 5 times. The simulation ran 10000 ms,
as expected for 2000 ms (mean runtime for 1 process) * 5

For 10 processes something more started to happen. Mainly, only 4 first processes completed the mean 2000
ms runtime, and were CPU blocked 3 times. Process 5 only got blocked 2 times, and run for 1000 ms, and 
process 6 got blocked only 1 time and run for 1000 ms too. The last 4 processes didn't have
any completion time. The reason behing it is that we specified 10000 ms as duration of simulation.
10000 ms = 2000 ms + 2000 ms + 2000 ms + 2000 ms + 1000 ms + 1000 ms. This gives us space for only 6 
first processes. The time for last two processes is shorter, as the application noticed, that 10000 ms
specified time is running out, reduced completion time for processes 5 and 6, and completely cut off
the last 4 processes.
